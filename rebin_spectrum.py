# Function to rebin a spectrum, writing to disk a copy of it and returning some basic info
def rebin_spectrum(infile, outfile, log_file, mincts=1, background_file=None):
    """
    Reads in an input file, rebins it to have >=mincts counts per bin, taking into account
        if there are bad channels at the beginning, and flagging as "bad" empty channels at the end.
    It writes the rebinned file as outfile to disk, and returns a tuple with the
        full path to the output file, total counts in the spectrum, total background counts, total net counts, exposure time, 
        and a flag which is 1 if the background counts are <=0, 2 if the net counts are <=0, and 0 otherwise    

    Parameters:
    - infile (str): input spectrum file
    - outfile (str): output rebinned spectrum file
    - log_file (str): The log file to write the messages.
    - mincts (int): minimum number of counts per bin (default=1)
    - background_file (str or None): optional background file path

    Returns:
    - spec_tuple (tuple): A tuple containing the full path and name for the output spectrum, total source counts, total background counts, total net counts, exposure time, a flag, and the signal-to-noise ratio
